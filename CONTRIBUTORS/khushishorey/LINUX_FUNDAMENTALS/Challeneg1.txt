1. Output on terminal:         geek{grep_is_good_to_find_things_cEDf1591}


2. Command used to search for this word:     grep -ao "geek{[^}]*}" file
  
The above command was used to find the secret flag. geek{[^}]*} this printed everything which starts with geek{ --> captures everything inside --> stops at the first }
-a --> it treated the file in which the flag was hidden as text
-o --> it printed the exact match/ans required, not the whole line

grep command is used to search for plan text data that matches a specific patter(here it was: `geek{}`).
